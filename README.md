TrueCaller-Terminal
===================

Terminal Version of True Caller.

Leverages the services of TrueCaller. Can be said as a PHP Client for it. However, it is difficult to parse the output using PHP. 

Still I am up for it. Let the parsing be complete and then the next step is to make a terminal alias for it. Basically, its for people like me who don't even bother to buy an android phone :P. No Whatsapp, no truecaller etc. I am fed up people kicking my ass for that :/ . . 

This can be a smart answer to them :). Coz u see, "Where there is Shell, there is a way!!"
